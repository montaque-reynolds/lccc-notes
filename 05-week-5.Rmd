# Utilitarianism

## Good and Right

* Creating good outcomes for as many people as possible
* creating as much good as possible

**Classical hedonistic utilitarinism**

* good = pleasure
* agent's duty = promote pleasure

* right $\rightarrow$ good
* good $\rightarrow$ right

> The main idea is that society is rightly ordered, and therefore just, when its major institutions are arranged so as to achieve the greatest net balance of satisfaction summed over all the individuals belonging to it.

What does this mean? It answers a question about what we most want.

* The good

And it answers a question about what we most want to do.

* The right

Ethics is about answer the order of these two questions

> The two main concepts of ethics are those of the right and the good; the concept of a morally worthy person is, I believe, derived from them. The structure of an ethical theory is, then, largely determined by how it defines and connects these two basic notions. Now it seems that the simplest way of relating them is taken by teleological theories: the good is defined independently from the right, and then the right is defined as that which maximizes the good. [@rawls03, 21--22]

The right is not so much concerned about consequences except in acting wrongly or doing the wrong thing. But it is not concerned with the consequences of doing the right or wrong thing.

* torture
* necessary killings

> From a utilitarian standpoint, it may make good sense to inflict pain on someone to prevent pain that would be inflicted on a a greater number of others. [@fial24, 97]

* Concerned about consequences therefore, **consequentialist**

Easy to quantify "good". We analyze the benefits and costs of different choices.

Consider transportation planning

![U.S. Pedestrian Deaths (2010--2022)](DBD-2024-graphics_All-fatalities-2011-2022-3.png)

Do we make our roads slower and safer? Or faster and more efficient?

Construction:

Erie Canal: Should you build a bridge that you knew was going to kill 1000 people, but employ 50,000 over an 8 year period?

Brooklyn Bridge: 30 out of 600?

Golden Gate: 11 deaths, 10 in one accident

Utilitarianism facilitates this kind of analysis and so it is tidy.

* For istance, imagine a theory that says that we can "detect beauty or moral goodness by the senses".

What does it mean to detect beauty and moral goodness? For instance as a sense of value:

> Similarly, the objectivist about value holds that evaluative properties are fully objective properties of valuable things, possessed irrespective of any relation to our subjective sentimental responses.

When we say that we value honesty, this just means to say that honesty has an objective quality that we can detect with our senses. A moral theory then would need to say, "whatever we detect as honest is good", but this is implausible.

* This is not tidy

## What is Good?

Utilitarianism however, we can calculate the GDP of a country, and then think of ways to improve the findings. Say a country like X has a GDP of 10. This is can objectively be improved to say 100 by increasing exports of gas.

Ultimately then, we want to increase the greatest happiness for the greatest number. What is happiness?

* Happiness
* Interests
* Pleasure
* Well-being
* Preferences?
* Benefit
* The valuable

What are the constituents of a good human life?

Some crude forms of consequentialism hold that pleasure is the only good outcome and that pain is the only bad outcome.

Intrinsic means "good for its own sake".

* Pleasure = intrinsic good
* Pain = *only* intrinsic evil

* Mitigate harm and increase benefit

#### Preference satisfaction

> as consisting in the satisfaction of actual or suitably informed or idealized desire. [@copp06]

**Subjective:**

Here, human good consists in or depends on one's contingent and variable psychological states.

**Objective:**

* perfecting one's essential capacities
  * education
  * endurance
  * patience
  * knowledge
  * beauty
  * achievement
  * friendship
  * equality

Who's intrinsic good? All sentient creatures? Human beings only? Human being's whose last names end in Y?
