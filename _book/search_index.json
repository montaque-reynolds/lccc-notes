You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

Record your responses, for instance, say what the scenario was (homeless drug addict vs. millionaire etc). After each scenario, there is a blurb that displays below saying the number of people who also made the same or alternate choice as you. Make sure that you also record this in your homework response. 5.1 LOs Describe differences between descriptive (psychological) egoism and ethical egoism Define altruism, empathy, compassion and love Explain criticisms of altruism and the importance of reciprocal altruism Explain the challenge posed by the prisoner’s dilemma Describe how the social contract provides a solution to problems of egoism Discuss how egoism is connected to laissez-faire capitalism and economics Evaluate the conflict between impartialiaty, egoism, and care Defend your own ideas about egoism, altruism, and the social contract 5.1.1 Empathy, Compassion, and Love Descriptive egoism (psychological egoism), people are basically selfish, that they always persue their own goals. Is competition good? Is it necessary? If empathy is the psycological capacity to understand what someone else is experiencing, then what does empathy have to do with egoism assuming that empathy is natural? What is compassion and how does it relate to empathy? Compassion builds on empathy, but how does it include the desire to alleviate suffering? Is this desire natural? What is love in light of empathy and compassion? How is it related to either of these concepts? The author defines love as intimacy and attachment. Is empathy devoid of intimacy? Is their empathy or attachment that includes intimacy and that which does not? For instance, is compassion for one’s girlfriend different than the compassion one would feel for a stranger? What about nepotism and employment? Do we have obligations to family members? Imagine that we have the choice to hire a stranger or a family member, and lets imagine that their qualifications are the same. Are we committing some moral infraction by hiring the family member? 5.1.2 The Debate about Egoism and Altruism 5.2 Psychological Egoism What Is Psychological Egoism? Is Psychological Egoism True? 5.3 Ethical Egoism What Is Ethical Egoism? Ethical Egoism argues that it is good for people to pursue their own interests. Altruism breeds dependency and undermines the self-esteem of those who receive benefits and gifts from do-gooder altruists. Is Ethical Egoism a Good Theory? 5.3.0.0.1 Who is Rand (1964)? But do people always act in their own self-interests? When do we exhibit akrasia? What is akrasia? “the basic concen is why we fail to do the things we know we ought to do.” * We might feel bad for a car accident victim and want to help, however we might be late for an important job interview and we have been out of work for several years. * Or, we might not want to help, but do not want to feel burdened by our memory of our failure to help and so we help. Is this akrasia? * We might think that we have an obligation to make the job interview on time, but our weakness of well causes us to help the accident victim instead. What is the paradox of hedonism? “The impulse towards pleasure defeats its own aim” [75]. We have a better chance of obtaining happiness if we do not pursue it. Is ethical egoism normative or descriptive? A fact about what we ought to do. 5.3.0.1 Individual vs. Universal ethical egoism What is the difference? People should look after their own interests or I should look after my own self-interests. Which is reciprocal altruism associated with? Value of ethical egoism vs. the fact of ethical egoism. 5.4 The Prisoner’s Dilemma The Social Contract Connections with Economic Theory 5.5 Impartiality, Egoism, and Care Care Ethics and the Challenge of Impartiality Why Be Moral? 5.6 Chapter Summary 5.7 Primary Source Readings Reading 4-1: The Ring of Gyges Reading 4-2: Self-Love Reading 4-3: Altruism in Nature Reading 4-4: Egoism, Altruism, and Care 5.8 Review Exercises Nietzsche and Samuel (2003) offers what many assume to be a criticism of altruism. It is actually one of the more significant criticisms of altruism in philosophical literature.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
